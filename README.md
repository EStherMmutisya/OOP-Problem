# DESCRIPTION 
You are the judge at a competitive eating competition and you need to choose a winner!

There are three foods at the competition and each type of food is worth a different amount of points. Points are as follows:

Chickenwings: 5 points

Hamburgers: 3 points

Hotdogs: 2 points

 

Write a function that helps you create a scoreboard. It takes as a parameter a list of objects representing the participants

It should return "name" and "score" properties sorted by score; if scores are equals, sort alphabetically by name.
 



 # HOW IT WORKS 
1.  Participants are represented as objects of the Competitor class, each with a name and consumption count for chicken wings, hamburgers, and hotdogs.
2. The program calculates the score for each participant based on the consumption counts using predefined scoring rules.
3. A scoreboard is generated listing participants' names and scores, sorted by score. If scores are tied, participants are sorted alphabetically by name.
